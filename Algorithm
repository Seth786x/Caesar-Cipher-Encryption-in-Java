1. Input the text and encryption key.
2. Define a function to encrypt the text using the Caesar cipher:
     a. Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted text.
     b. Iterate through each character in the text:
         i. If the character is uppercase, shift it by (character - 'A' + key) % 26.
         ii. If the character is lowercase, shift it by (character - 'a' + key) % 26.
         iii. Append the shifted character to the encrypted text.
         iv. If the character is not an alphabet, append it unchanged.
     c. Return the encrypted text.
3. Define a function to decrypt the text using the Caesar cipher:
     a. Initialize an empty string to store the decrypted text.
     b. Iterate through each character in the text:
         i. If the character is uppercase, shift it by (character - 'A' - key + 26) % 26.
         ii. If the character is lowercase, shift it by (character - 'a' - key + 26) % 26.
         iii. Append the shifted character to the decrypted text.
         iv. If the character is not an alphabet, append it unchanged.
     c. Return the decrypted text.
4. Encrypt the input text using the encryption key.
5. Decrypt the encrypted text using the same encryption key.
6. Output the original text, encrypted text, and decrypted text.
