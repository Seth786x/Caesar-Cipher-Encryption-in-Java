# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-in-Java

The Caesar Cypher encryption and decryption algorithm is implemented in this Java programme. A sort of substitution cypher known as the Caesar Cypher involves moving every letter in the plaintext up or down the alphabet by a predetermined amount.

Usage in Practice:
- Applications with Low Security: Fit for scenarios where obfuscation is more important than robust security. Children's games and toys with basic encoding systems are among the examples.

- Data masking: This technique is occasionally used to hide data from casual observation in low-security settings.

Disadvantages:
- Frequency analysis poses a problem to encryption since it relies on the identifiable patterns of letter frequencies in a language. Attackers can use these patterns to decipher messages 
  encrypted with simple cyphers like the Caesar cypher by comparing the letter frequencies in the ciphertext with those in the language. Using this method will make it easier for attackers to 
  decipher the message.
  
- Merely 25 shifts are possible in the key space (not counting the trivial shift of 0). Because of this, attempting every key combination via brute force is simple.

- Not Suitable for Secure Communications: In contemporary applications, the Caesar cypher is not employed for secure communications because of the aforementioned drawbacks.
